# Embedded Systems Learning Period

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **MPLAB X IDE** (or any other IDE/toolchain that supports AVR 8-bit MCUs, such as Microchip Studio)
- **Git** (installed and configured on your system)
- Basic familiarity with programming concepts (helpful but not required)

## Introduction

This tutorial series introduces the **fundamental concepts of embedded C programming** using the **AVR128DA48** microcontroller as the target platform.  
You will learn how to configure microcontroller registers, use interrupts, communicate over serial interfaces, and structure your embedded projects into multiple source files.

Each task builds on the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity.  
By the end of the learning period, you will have a solid understanding of both **embedded programming** and **practical Git usage**.
